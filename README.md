<h1 id="-get-next-line">üìÇ Get Next Line</h1>
<p>I carried out this project as part of my schooling at 42 Perpignan. It consists of coding a function called get_next_line which reads and returns the line of a file descriptor on each call.<br>
For more details, I invite you to read the topic provided in the repo.<br><br>
Consider compiling with "cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx" (xx being a number of your choice).</p>

<h2 id ="-bonus part">‚≠ê Bonus Part</h2>
<p>The bonus part consists of creating this same function with additional features: I must use a single static variable and my function must be able to read several file descriptors at the same time.<br><br>
The compilation is the same as in the obligatory part.</p>
